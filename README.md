# Work Boots Console

Monolithic FastAPI service for contractor lead intake and follow-up operations.

## Overview

It supports:
- manual lead intake
- GoDaddy email intake
- lead deduplication and event tracking
- response-time and stale-lead reporting
- reminder/escalation runs for untouched leads
- notification delivery adapters with business-level controls

- `lead-intake-engine-api.md`

## Notification Provider Modes
Set provider selection in `.env`:
- `SMS_PROVIDER=mock|dev|twilio`
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER=mock|dev|smtp`

Default local mode is `mock`.  
When using `twilio` or `smtp`, configure the corresponding credentials in `.env`.

## API Credential Auth
- Primary auth path is DB-backed bearer credentials in `api_credentials`.
- Credentials are tied to persisted principals in `principals` scoped by business.
- Principals have minimal roles (`admin`, `operator`) for sensitive business actions.
- Manage principals per business (admin only):
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/principals`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/principals`
  - `PATCH /api/businesses/{business_id}/principals/{principal_id}`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/principals/{principal_id}/activate`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/principals/{principal_id}/deactivate`
- Manage credentials per business:
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/credentials`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/credentials/{credential_id}/disable`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/credentials/{credential_id}/revoke`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/credentials/{credential_id}/rotate`
- View auth/admin audit history per business (admin only):
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/auth-audit-events`
- Credential-management endpoints require an `admin` principal role.
- Issued token plaintext is shown once at creation/rotation; only `token_hash` is persisted.
- Credentials store non-secret metadata for operations: `label`, `last_used_at`, `rotated_from_credential_id`.
- Successful DB credential authentication updates `last_used_at`.
- Inactive principals are blocked from authentication and admin operations immediately.
- Principals store non-secret metadata for lifecycle/audit visibility:
  - `created_by_principal_id`
  - `updated_by_principal_id`
  - `last_authenticated_at`
- Auth/admin audit events are persisted for principal and credential lifecycle actions with business scope and actor/target context.
- Audit payloads exclude secret fields (`token`, `token_hash`).
- `API_TOKEN_HASH_PEPPER` is required in production.
- Legacy unpeppered hash verification is off by default and can be enabled temporarily with `ALLOW_LEGACY_TOKEN_HASH_FALLBACK=true`.
- Legacy shared-token auth (`API_AUTH_TOKEN` / `API_AUTH_BUSINESS_ID`) is no longer part of runtime auth resolution.

Out of scope in this pass: full IAM/user-role management and enterprise-grade audit retention/compliance tooling.
