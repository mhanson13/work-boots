## SEO.ai Implementation Status
Implemented today:
- Phase 1: deterministic site audit + findings + manual-trigger audit summaries
- Phase 1.5: hardening/usability improvements for audit diagnostics and contracts
- Phase 2: competitor foundations, snapshotting, deterministic comparison runs/reports, and manual-trigger competitor summaries
- Phase 3A: deterministic recommendation runs generated from persisted audit/comparison evidence
- Phase 3B: deterministic recommendation workflow state, prioritization views, and operator update APIs

Not implemented yet:
- Phase 3C AI recommendation narratives
- Phase 4 automation/operationalization work

## SEO.ai Phase 2 (Implemented)
Current competitor-intelligence endpoints (business-scoped):
Architecture notes:
- deterministic comparison findings and rollups are persisted first
- AI is used only for manual-trigger comparison summaries from persisted comparison outputs
- no AI-generated findings or recommendations

  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/comparison-runs/{run_id}/summaries/latest`
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/comparison-summaries/{summary_id}`

Compatibility site-scoped Phase 2 paths are also mounted at:
- `/api/v1/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/...`

## SEO.ai Phase 3A (Implemented)
Deterministic recommendations are derived from persisted SEO audit findings and persisted competitor comparison findings/rollups.

Endpoint inventory (business-scoped):
- Recommendation runs:
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/recommendation-runs`
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/recommendation-runs`
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/recommendation-runs/{recommendation_run_id}`
- Recommendations:
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/recommendation-runs/{recommendation_run_id}/recommendations`
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/recommendations/{recommendation_id}`
- Deterministic recommendation report:
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/recommendation-runs/{recommendation_run_id}/report`

Compatibility site-scoped Phase 3A paths are also mounted at:
- `/api/v1/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/...`

## SEO.ai Phase 3B (Implemented)
Phase 3B adds deterministic workflow and prioritization management over persisted recommendations.

Endpoint inventory (business-scoped):
- Site recommendation workflow:
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/recommendations`
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/recommendations/{recommendation_id}`
  - `PATCH /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/recommendations/{recommendation_id}`
- Deterministic prioritization views:
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/recommendations/backlog`
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/recommendations/prioritized-report`

Compatibility site-scoped Phase 3B paths are also mounted at:
- `/api/v1/businesses/{business_id}/seo/sites/{site_id}/...`

## Notification Provider Modes
Set provider selection in `.env`:
- `SMS_PROVIDER=mock|dev|twilio`
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER=mock|dev|smtp`

Default local mode is `mock`.  
When using `twilio` or `smtp`, configure the corresponding credentials in `.env`.

## API Credential Auth
- Primary auth path is DB-backed bearer credentials in `api_credentials`.
- Credentials are tied to persisted principals in `principals` scoped by business.
- Principals have minimal roles (`admin`, `operator`) for sensitive business actions.
- Manage principals per business (admin only):
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/principals`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/principals`
  - `PATCH /api/businesses/{business_id}/principals/{principal_id}`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/principals/{principal_id}/activate`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/principals/{principal_id}/deactivate`
- Manage credentials per business:
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/credentials`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/credentials/{credential_id}/disable`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/credentials/{credential_id}/revoke`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/credentials/{credential_id}/rotate`
- View auth/admin audit history per business (admin only):
  - `GET /api/businesses/{business_id}/auth-audit-events`
- Credential-management endpoints require an `admin` principal role.
- Issued token plaintext is shown once at creation/rotation; only `token_hash` is persisted.
- Credentials store non-secret metadata for operations: `label`, `last_used_at`, `rotated_from_credential_id`.
- Successful DB credential authentication updates `last_used_at`.
- Inactive principals are blocked from authentication and admin operations immediately.
- Principals store non-secret metadata for lifecycle/audit visibility:
  - `created_by_principal_id`
  - `updated_by_principal_id`
  - `last_authenticated_at`
- Auth/admin audit events are persisted for principal and credential lifecycle actions with business scope and actor/target context.
- Audit payloads exclude secret fields (`token`, `token_hash`).
- Application-level abuse protections are enabled by default:
  - bearer-auth request throttling (client IP keyed)
  - stricter admin-route throttling for principal/credential/audit management actions
  - throttled requests return `429 Rate limit exceeded. Retry later.`
- Rate limits are configurable via:
  - `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`
  - `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS` / `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`
  - `ADMIN_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS` / `ADMIN_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`
- `API_TOKEN_HASH_PEPPER` is required in production.
- Legacy unpeppered hash verification is off by default and can be enabled temporarily with `ALLOW_LEGACY_TOKEN_HASH_FALLBACK=true`.
- Legacy shared-token auth (`API_AUTH_TOKEN` / `API_AUTH_BUSINESS_ID`) is no longer part of runtime auth resolution.

Out of scope in this pass: full IAM/user-role management and enterprise-grade audit retention/compliance tooling.
