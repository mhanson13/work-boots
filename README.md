## Documentation
Project docs live under [`docs/`](docs):
- `lead-intake-engine.md`
- `lead-intake-engine-api.md`

## Notification Provider Modes
Set provider selection in `.env`:
- `SMS_PROVIDER=mock|dev|twilio`
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER=mock|dev|smtp`

Default local mode is `mock`.  
When using `twilio` or `smtp`, configure the corresponding credentials in `.env`.

## API Credential Auth
- Primary auth path is DB-backed bearer credentials in `api_credentials`.
- Manage credentials per business:
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/credentials`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/credentials/{credential_id}/disable`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/credentials/{credential_id}/revoke`
  - `POST /api/businesses/{business_id}/credentials/{credential_id}/rotate`
- Issued token plaintext is shown once at creation/rotation; only `token_hash` is persisted.
- `API_TOKEN_HASH_PEPPER` is required in production.
- Legacy unpeppered hash verification is off by default and can be enabled temporarily with `ALLOW_LEGACY_TOKEN_HASH_FALLBACK=true`.
- Env compatibility auth (`API_AUTH_PRINCIPALS_JSON`) is non-production only and gated by `ALLOW_AUTH_COMPAT_FALLBACK` (off by default).
- Legacy shared-token auth (`API_AUTH_TOKEN` / `API_AUTH_BUSINESS_ID`) is no longer part of runtime auth resolution.

Out of scope in this pass: full IAM/user-role management.

Archived legacy scaffolding and deprecated files live under [`_archive/`](_archive).
