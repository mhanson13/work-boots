# Work Boots Console Architecture

## Overview
Work Boots Console is a single FastAPI monolith focused on contractor lead intake and follow-up operations.

```

## Runtime Flow
1. Intake routes receive manual or email lead payloads.
2. Services parse/normalize/dedupe and persist leads.
3. Lead events are appended for auditability and timeline views.
4. Reminder job scans stale `new` leads and triggers mock notifications.
5. Summary endpoints expose pipeline and response metrics.

## Tenant Context
- Tenant scope is resolved at the API boundary via server-side request context dependency (`get_tenant_context`).
- Preferred auth path is principal-bound credentials (`API_AUTH_PRINCIPALS_JSON`): bearer token -> `principal_id` -> `business_id`.
- Tenant-sensitive routes pass only auth-derived tenant `business_id` into services/repositories.
- Client-supplied `business_id` fields/query params are compatibility-only and are not trusted; mismatches are rejected.
- Legacy shared-token mode (`API_AUTH_TOKEN` + `API_AUTH_BUSINESS_ID`) remains as temporary compatibility fallback.
- Dev/test-only fallback uses `DEFAULT_BUSINESS_ID` when no auth config is present.
- Service/repository/database tenant checks remain in place as defense in depth.

## Design Principles
- One deployable backend process.
- Explicit service/repository boundaries.
- Thin route handlers.
- Rules-based parsing and reminder logic.
- Mocks behind provider interfaces for external integrations.

## Archived Components
Legacy TypeScript backend scaffolding and deprecated scripts are preserved under `_archive/`.
