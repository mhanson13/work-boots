# UI Workspace

## Prompt Preview vs Last Run

Prompt preview and run history are different concepts:

- Prompt preview: current assembled prompt payload returned by workspace summary preview fields.
- Last run: historical execution metadata from previously completed/failed runs.

Rules:

- Workspace prompt panel must render only preview payload prompt text.
- Last-run metadata must never be concatenated into preview prompt text.
- If preview is unavailable, hide the preview panel rather than falling back to run prompt content.

## No Merging Rule

- Do not combine `latest_run` data with `*_prompt_preview.user_prompt` or `*_prompt_preview.system_prompt`.
- Do not preserve prior prompt body text across site changes or refreshes when new preview payload is received.

## Competitor Run Quality States

The workspace competitor panel includes a compact terminal-run quality summary line:

- proposed
- returned
- rejected
- degraded mode (`yes`/`no`)
- search-backed (`yes`/`no`)

Operator-facing notes are shown when telemetry indicates risk:

- low returned volume (`<= 2`)
- high validation rejection volume
- degraded retry used
- search-backed discovery unavailable

For very low outcomes (`<= 1` returned), the panel renders a concise explanatory message using only observed run metadata and does not invent remediation steps.

## Admin Competitor Timeout Controls

Admin settings include two competitor-generation timeout controls:

- `Competitor Primary Timeout Seconds`
- `Competitor Degraded Retry Timeout Seconds`

Control semantics:

- Primary timeout applies to the first full search-backed attempt.
- Degraded retry timeout applies to reduced-context timeout recovery attempts.
- Allowed range: `10-90` seconds.
- Blank value keeps deployment/provider default timeout behavior.

## Admin GCP Logs Query Controls

Admin tab includes a compact `GCP Logs Query` panel for Cloud Logging troubleshooting without direct GCP console access.

Controls:

- multiline Logs Explorer filter input
- bounded page size selector (`10`, `25`, `50`, `100`)
- `Run Query` action
- `Next Page` action when backend returns `next_page_token`
- sample filter list with `Use` buttons

Result display:

- compact table rows with timestamp, severity, log name, resource, insert id, and payload summary
- scope/order line showing effective backend settings (`projects/<configured-project>`, `timestamp desc`)
- explicit loading, empty, invalid-query, permission, and timeout states

Backend behavior remains admin-only and uses runtime ADC via attached service account.
